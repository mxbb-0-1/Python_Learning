# Integers definition of the Integer class Def: A Integer is a number that can be written without a fractional
# component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5 1⁄2, and √2 are not. The set of integers
# consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), also called whole numbers or counting numbers,
# and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., −1, −2, −3, ...).

# Operations that can be performed on integers
# 1. Addition (+): Adds two integers together.
# 2. Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second integer from the first.
# 3. Multiplication (*): Multiplies two integers.
# 4. Division (/): Divides the first integer by the second.
# 5. Floor Division (//): Performs integer division, discarding the remainder.
# 6. Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division.
# 7. Exponentiation (**): Raises the first integer to the power of the second.
# 8. Bitwise AND (&): Performs bitwise AND operation.
# 9. Bitwise OR (|): Performs bitwise OR operation.
# 10. Bitwise XOR (^): Performs bitwise exclusive OR operation.
# 11. Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts the bits of the integer.
# 12. Bitwise Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the integer to the left.
# 13. Bitwise Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the integer to the right.
